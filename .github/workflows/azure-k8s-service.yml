# This workflow will build and push an application to a Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster when you push your code
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target AKS cluster and have created an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
# For instructions see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal
# https://github.com/Azure/aks-create-action
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set the following secrets in your repository:
#    - AZURE_CREDENTIALS (instructions for getting this https://github.com/Azure/login#configure-a-service-principal-with-a-secret)
#
# 2. Set the following environment variables (or replace the values below):
#    - AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY (name of your container registry)
#    - PROJECT_NAME
#    - RESOURCE_GROUP (where your cluster is deployed)
#    - CLUSTER_NAME (name of your AKS cluster)
#
# 3. Choose the approrpiate render engine for the bake step https://github.com/Azure/k8s-bake. The config below assumes helm, then set
#    any needed environment variables such as:
#    - CHART_PATH 
#    - CHART_OVERRIDE_PATH
